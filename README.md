# Drone project

This is a project to implement a custom-build for a drone. Following image shows a basic first working implementation of a drone self controlling and stabilizing using Kalman Filter and Complementary filters for corrected pose estimates and control.

## PS: Code under Development
Known issues: Current version of code will give correct pose estimates with Kalman Filter, but further testing needs to be done with Complementary filter.
